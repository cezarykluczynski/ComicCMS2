Work in progress.

This project is aimed at recreating some of the functionalities of 
[ComicCMS](http://comiccms.com/). It does not share any common code,
not does it offer any path of migration from the original.

It started as a learning project for some new technologies I wanted to
familiarize myself with, and it could be abandonded at any time.
Use with caution, or actually don't use it at all, at least for now,
because it have almost no functionalities implemented.

here are the requirements:
